# Treat_the_needy
The Food Waste Management System is designed to reduce the wastage of food in family
functions, private events and during festive time. The remaining food during the functions can be donated to the needy people through NGOs with the help of this system. Treat the needy is a web application developed using html, css, javascript and MySQL. In this system donors and NGOs can have their own account. Donors and receivers can register and login into the application. 

Donors can,
1. post their food availability
2. edit their profile
3. send verification request to admin to get a verified account
4. view the their previous food take-up requests

Receivers can,
1. view the request posted by donors
2. edit their profile
3. send verification request to admin to get a verified account
4. view their previously accepted requests.

The admin can verify the donors' and receivers' accounts. 
Overall this project serves the people who are in need of food and at the same time reduces food wastage.
